# DesignPatternsComposite
This is a demo for the Composite Design Parttern using C# to allocate a resouce to a tree structure.

As described by Gof:
"Compose objects into tree structure to represent part-whole hierarchies.Composite lets client treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly".
Composite design pattern treats each node in two ways-Composite or leaf.Composite means it can have other objects below it.leaf means it has no objects below it.
